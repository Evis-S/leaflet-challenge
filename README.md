# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge
In this challenge, I had  been tasked with developing Leaflet library to visualize earthquake provided by USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations.I chose "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

I creatd a map that plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. And earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
I created a legend that will provide context for my map data.
